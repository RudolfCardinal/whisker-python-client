Usage
=====

There are three styles of Whisker client available. Full worked examples are
provided, along with a rationale for their use; see :ref:`Rationale`. The
outlines, however, look like these:

Twisted client (preferred for simple interfaces)
------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from twisted.internet import reactor
    from whisker.twistedclient import WhiskerTwistedTask

    class MyWhiskerTask(WhiskerTwistedTask):
        # ...

    w = MyWhiskerTask()
    w.connect(...)
    reactor.run()

Qt client (preferred for GUI use)
---------------------------------

More complex; see the Starfeeder project example.

Raw socket client (deprecated)
------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from whisker.rawsocketclient import WhiskerRawSocketClient

    w = WhiskerRawSocketClient()
    w.connect_both_ports(...)
    # ...
    for line in w.getlines_mainsocket():
        # ...
